# Digipaws: Reclaim Your Digital Wellbeing

Digipaws is an open-source digital wellbeing tool designed to empower you to break free from unproductive phone habits and cultivate positive alternatives. 

## Features:

* **Habit Transformation:** Digipaws intelligently replaces negative phone behaviors with enriching activities. When you attempt to access a blocked app, the app activates "Survival Mode," temporarily restricting all apps for an hour. You can then choose a productive "Quest" (like a short run) to unlock your device sooner.
* **Customizable Blockers:** Take control of your digital environment by blocking apps, notifications with specific keywords, and unwanted in-app screens (e.g., YouTube shorts, comments). 
* **Minimalistic Launcher:** Streamline your phone experience with a built-in, distraction-free launcher. It replaces your default launcher with a simplified layout, minimizing visual temptations.
* **Privacy-Focused and Open-Source:** Digipaws prioritizes your privacy. Being open-source ensures transparency and allows for community contributions.
